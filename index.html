                <h2>What is computer Science?? &#129300;</h2>
                <p>
                    Computer science is the study of how to use computers to solve
                    problems. It involves developing software, designing computer
                    systems and networks, and understanding how computers can be used to
                    process and analyze data.
                    In short, computer science is all about using computers to make our lives easier and to solve
                    complex problems.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Out of the available computer science topics, i have picked
                    software development as my area of interest.
                    Software development is the process of creating computer programs, which are sets of instructions
                    that tell a computer what to do.
                    This involves designing the program, writing the code,
                    and testing it to make sure it works as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software development branches into fields as well. A programmer can choose
                    to create sofware for anything that has a screen! Including but not limited to:
                    Smart TVs, smart watches, computers, phones, even <em>fridges</em>
                    In this website, i will be talking about web development; which is the art of crating websites
                    and making them work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website will showcase my journey in learning web development, and some of
                    the resources i have used to achieving the latter.

                <h3>Understanding Theory</h3>
                <p>The first step in studying computer science, is familiarizing yourself
                    with the world of technology, how computers work, and what makes up the internet.
                    Starting with a high-level programming language is an essential step to go through the theory
                    of computer science. such as Python, C++ or Java.<br>
                    <a href="https://youtube.com"> Youtube</a> is a good place to get started with the generalities of Coding.
                    personally, i have been watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia">TraversyMedia's</a> videos to have a better grip on the theories of HTML5 & CSS3
                    Moving to a paid-course or an introductory bootcamp is a good step to further hone those skills.
                    For reference, i usually go to this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML elements</a> document, alongside this
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS</a> page to review my implementation of code!
                     this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">course</a> is a good example of a budget-friendly online full stack development material.

                <h3>Guided Application</h3>
                <p>
                    After builidng the necessary skills in a certain programming language,
                    a good practice is to start with actual projects.
                    Starting by copying online projects is benefitial, but only in the beginning.
                    It helps by making the programmer familiar with more vertical aspects of how systems and applications work.
                    I have personally started by taking this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer">coursera</a>
                </p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Personal Applications & Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, Starting with a personal complete project alongside a Github is a nice way to polish this experience.
                    Having an online presence where one's personal projects are showcased is so important, especially later for recruiters and potential employers.
